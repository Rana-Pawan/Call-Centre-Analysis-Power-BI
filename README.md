# Call-Centre-Analysis-Power-BI
The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of call centre performance, including call volume, average handle time, and customer satisfaction ratings. By analyzing this data, call centre managers can make informed decisions to improve operations and provide better customer service.
I used Power BI to create a visually appealing and easy-to-use dashboard, with the ability to filter data by date range, call topic , and agent. I have also included a feature to tooltip for different time-zone during the day for deeper analysis.
